# cilium-actions

This repository contains the logic behind the GitHub actions being executed
in `github.com/cilium/cilium`

## Configuration

Configuration needs to located at `.github/maintainers-little-helper.yml`.

All the supported options are:

```yaml
# If project and column are set, all open and re-open PRs are automatically
# added to this project.
project: "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/80"
column: "In progress"
# Move To Projects For Labels XORed will move PR for the project and column
# depending which of the labels are set. If 2 or more labels are set for the
# same branch, for example if `needs-backport/1.6` and `backport-pending/1.6`
# are set, no action will be performed.
move-to-projects-for-labels-xored:
  v1.6:
    needs-backport/1.6:
      project: "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/1"

    backport-pending/1.6:
      project: "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/1"
      column: "Backport pending to v1.6"
    backport-done/1.6:
      project: "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/projects/1"
      column: "Backport done to v1.6"
